This modern take on crimping adds a unique twist without overwhelming your overall style.\n* Pro Tip: This is a must-try for post-root touchups.

Here’s what you need to do:\n\n1. Seal the Style: Use a lightweight hairspray to lock in the texture without making your hair feel stiff or crunchy.\n2. Add Volume: For extra oomph, gently tease the roots with a comb.\n3. Hydrate: Crimping can dry out your hair, so use a nourishing hair serum or oil on the ends to keep them hydrated.\n4. Touch Up: If some sections lose their crimp, quickly go over them with your crimper or a flat iron twist. Protect\n5. Overnight: Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce frizz and keep your crimped hairstyles intact.\n\n## Why Crimped Hairstyles Are Perfect for Long Hair?\n\n**<img alt=\"Why-Crimped-Hairstyles-Are-Perfect-for-Long-Hair\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Why-Crimped-Hairstyles-Are-Perfect-for-Long-Hair.png\">**\n\nCrimped hairstyles add depth, texture, and volume, making them an ideal choice for hairstyles for long hair.

This style incorporates multiple braids, often intertwined or twisted, to form an elaborate bun. It’s a perfect match for heavily embellished bridal outfits and grand ceremonies, ensuring the hairstyle commands attention while staying secure throughout the festivities.\n\n## Expert Advice for the Perfect Juda Hairstyle\n\nThe perfect bridal juda can truly elevate your look to a another level. Here’s how you can ensure your hairstyle looks flawless and stays intact throughout your special day:\n\n**1. Start with Clean, Prepped Hair:**\n\nWhile freshly washed hair can be slippery, slightly day-old hair holds styles better. If your hair tends to get oily, use a dry shampoo to add freshness without losing texture. This step works well for all styles, especially when paired with haircuts for long hair, like layers or feathered ends, which add movement and enhance the overall look.\n\n**2. Texture Is Key:**\n\nFor a voluminous look, start by adding texture. Use a texturizing spray, mousse, or volumising powder to give your hair a good grip. This helps create structure and prevents the bun from looking flat.\n\n**3. Secure the Base:**\n\nA solid foundation is crucial for a juda that lasts all day. Section your hair properly and use elastic bands to tie it securely before starting the bun. This prevents slippage and ensures longevity.\n\n**4. Invest in Quality Tools:**\n\nOpt for sturdy pins, strong-hold hairspray, and high-quality elastics. This is a non-negotiable to keep your juda intact through hours of celebrations, dancing, and rituals.\n\n**5. Add Personal Touches:**\n\nCollaborate with your hairstylist to incorporate details that match your wedding aesthetic. Be it fresh flowers, Gajras, ornate pins, or jewellery, ensure your juda compliments your outfit and enhances your overall look.\n\n**6. Balance Is Key:**\n\nChoose a style that works with your face shape and outfit. For example, a sleek bun suits traditional sarees, while a messy textured juda can complement boho-inspired lehengas.\n\n**7. Test the Style in Advance:**\n\nSchedule a trial session with your hairstylist before the big day. This ensures the look aligns with your vision and gives you a chance to make any adjustments.\n\n**8. Stay Comfortable:**\n\nFinally, ensure the juda is not too tight or heavy. A styled bun should be secure yet comfortable enough to wear for hours without causing discomfort.\n\n## Jewellery and Florals: The Essential Accents\n\nA hallmark of juda hairstyles is their versatility with accessories. Brides can opt for fresh roses, jasmine strands, or marigold arrangements to lend a natural, traditional look to their bridal hair juda. For a grander statement, some brides incorporate family heirlooms like vintage brooches or gold-finished hairpieces into their juda. Paired with haircuts for long hair, such as soft layers or face-framing cuts, these elements add depth and a touch of personal history to the hairstyle, making it as meaningful as it is beautiful.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn its many forms, the bridal hair juda remains an ideal style for weddings and celebrations. Its ability to adapt to different aesthetics—traditional, modern, or fusion—ensures its place as a cult favorite. For brides and celebrants alike and with the right accessories and expert styling, the juda becomes the perfect addition to a bridal look.\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Keerat Kohli](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/Keerat%20Kohli.png)\n\nKeerat KohliKeerat Kohli is a beauty and lifestyle writer who often boasts her expertise as the self-proclaimed beauty guru of her friend group.

It’s been popular among men for some time now and is unlikely to go away in 2025. Fade haircuts are everywhere and easy to get. Walk into a salon and just sit and ask for one, your barber will know what to do. It’s manageable, sharp and relatively low maintenance as well. David Beckham loves it. Brad Pitt too. And Cillian Murphy a.k.a Thomas Shelby, the fictional character and protagonist of the British period crime drama Peaky Blinders aced it to the next level. My consensus? It’s a pretty modern look for both genders. However, the faded haircut has a winding history and stretches back decades\n\n\n\n## Understanding Low Fade Haircuts\n\nOriginating in the 1940-1950 era from the U.S. military, this well-groomed haircut has many variations, each created with harsh lines and angles that signalled you mean business. To dive deeper into this, I reached out to **<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vaishakhi_haria/\" target=\"_blank\">Vaishakhi Haria</a>**, founder of Splash Salons in multiple locations in Mumbai, and co-founder of Very V Salon in Borivali, having amassed 17 years of experience in the hairdressing industry. So, <a href=\"https://www.bebeautiful.in/all-things-hair/haircuts-and-styles/why-the-low-fade-is-the-most-versatile-men-haircut\" target=\"_blank\">what is a low fade haircut?</a> “Fades can bring out the bone structure of the person and it brings sharpness to the overall look”, she comments on the hairstyle. For those looking to limit regular visits to barbers, this may be a good one as fades take a long to grow out. “If you intend to grow the fade out, you have to be ready to wait a minimum of 6 months without a haircut. For some men, this can be a bit frustrating.”\n\n## Low Fade Haircuts For Different Face Shapes\n\nFade haircuts vary and are large of three types. The low skin fade is approximately 1 inch above the natural hairline. The fade drops down behind the ears and around the back of the head, keeping an inch of skin shown relatively even all the way around. It’s clean and neat. With a mid-fade, the skin runs higher up on the head, starting from around the brow, it again drops down behind the ears and behind the back of the head, but drops only a little at the back. High fade on the other hand is also a polished and sharp look that involves a dramatic tapering of the hair at a higher point on the head. Vaishakhi adds, “A classic low fade is a style that never goes out of trend and it suits most hair types. Keeping the top a bit longer gives versatility in styling the hair in various ways.”\n\nThe key is to know which fade hairstyle works for you. We did the next best thing; we asked the expert herself.\n\n## Fade Haircut For Square Face Shape - The Short Low Fade Haircut\n\n**Why it Works?**\n\nHighlighting the angular jawline, this style features a textured top that adds dimension, preventing the haircut from looking too harsh. Plus, it’s versatile, modern, and universally stylish.\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Sqaure%20shaped.png)\n\n## Fade Haircut For Oval Face Shape - Low Taper Fade\n\n**Why it works?**\n\nThis style starts low near the sideburns and gradually tapers down to the neckline, creating a subtle gradient. Unlike a traditional fade, the taper keeps some hair at the edges for a softer finish. It’s ideal for men with thin hair because it adds structure and sharpness to your overall look. So, by keeping the sides short and the top slightly longer, this cut creates the illusion of more volume.\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/oval%20shaped.png)\n\n## Fade Haircut For Round Face Shape - Classic Low Fade and Mid Fade with a Long Top\n\n**Why it works?**\n\nA low fade or mid fade paired with a long top is the perfect combination for a round face. It starts low, just above the ears, and gradually tapers down to the neckline. The long top adds height and creates the illusion of length, balancing out the roundness.\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Round.png)\n\n## Fade Haircut For Heart Face Shape - A Bald Fade\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Heart%20shaped.png)\n\n**Why it Works?**\n\nA heart-shaped face features a broad forehead, prominent cheekbones, and a narrow chin. To complement and balance this, a bald fade works perfectly.\n\nOnce you’ve zeroed down on which type of fade works best for your face shape, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Maintenance: When thinking about maintenance, usually 3 weeks is an ideal timeline to visit your hairdresser.\n2. Wash regularly and use a hair mask: You can try a leave-in treatment mask that aids in repairing hair damage and restoring hair to a healthy state. A professional molecular repair mask by K-18 will work wonders. This award-winning cream-based mask delivers immediate and lasting results.\n3. Invest in quality products: Whether it’s simply washing your hair or styling, always use good quality products for best results. Try Toni&Guy’s Sea Salt Texturising Hair Spray. It adds texture and volume, leaving you with a crunchy feel.\n4. Protect your hair: Over styling can easily lead to hair fall, pushing back your hairline without you even noticing it until it’s too late. A heat protection mist is strongly recommended.\n5. Choose a trusted hairstylist: Even though it’s a simple haircut, an experienced barber will be able to create seamless gradients.\n\nYou’re all set to create your perfect low fade hairstyle now!\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Praneet Sahni Kalani](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/praneet-kalani.png)\n\nPraneet Sahni KalaniPraneet Sahni Kalani is a fashion & lifestyle writer.

In 2024, the side part is back, making waves (both literally and figuratively) in the world of hairstyling. Once a staple in vintage glamour and early 2000s fashion, this timeless look is evolving in exciting ways. Whether you're looking for a sleek, polished finish or a relaxed, undone vibe, the side part is here to add a fresh twist to your style.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll break down how the side part has made its comeback, explore the best haircut styles for different hair types, and give you all the tips and tricks for maintaining this effortlessly chic look. Ready to embrace the side part revolution? Let’s dive in!\n\n\n\n## The Evolution of the Side Part Haircut: From Classic to Modern\n\n1. The Side Part’s Retro Influence : The side part has a rich history that can be traced back to the 1920s, where it symbolized the height of sophistication and elegance. Think of the sharply parted, slicked-back styles of silent film stars or the polished looks of Hollywood’s golden age. Over the decades, the side part evolved, embracing softer waves in the 1950s and voluminous blowouts in the 1980s. Fast forward to the 2000s, and we see the side part reemerge as a casual go-to for celebrities and everyday individuals alike, with everyone from Jennifer Aniston to David Beckham making it a must-have look. Now in 2024, the side part is back – this time with modern updates that make it suitable for all genders and hair textures.\n2. Modern Twists on the Classic Look : In 2024, the side part is no longer just about being sleek and polished. The trend now incorporates textured finishes, edgy layers, and even messy waves. From soft, romantic curls to a more structured, asymmetrical part, hairstylists are taking the side part to new levels. This modern approach gives it a fresh, youthful vibe that’s adaptable for both everyday wear and special occasions.\n3. Gender-Neutral Appeal : The side part’s appeal in 2024 is not just for women. Men have been adopting the look for years, making it a versatile and gender-neutral trend. Whether paired with a short, structured cut or long, flowing locks, the side part works for everyone. It’s a perfect balance of classic meets contemporary, and its adaptability is a key reason for its resurgence.\n4. Best Face Shapes for the Side Part : While the side part is universally flattering, it tends to suit certain face shapes better. Oval, square, and heart-shaped faces benefit the most from this style, as it helps balance features and adds structure. For round faces, a deep side part can create the illusion of length, while angular faces can soften their features with a gentler, sweeping part.\n\n## 2024’s Trending Side Part Haircuts for Different Hair Types\n\n1. Side Parts for Curly Hair : For those with curly hair, the side part is a game changer. By embracing your hair’s natural volume and texture, a side part can enhance curls, creating a look that’s both structured and playful. Go for a soft, romantic part with loose curls or a more defined part for a dramatic statement.\n2. Fine and Straight Hair : If you have fine or straight hair, a side part can instantly add dimension and volume. Shifting your part to the side breaks up the flatness, giving your hair a fuller, more dynamic appearance. Pair the side part with layers or a sleek bob for maximum effect.\n3. Thick and Wavy Hair : For thick, wavy hair, the side part is the perfect way to enhance your natural texture. A deep side part can add a touch of sophistication, while a loose, undone part will create a more relaxed, bohemian vibe. The side part offers the flexibility to play with volume, making it ideal for both casual and formal looks.\n4. Short to Long Cuts : The beauty of the side part is its versatility, whether you have a pixie cut, bob, or long layers. Pixie cuts with a side part can look edgy and modern, while bobs take on a chic, Parisian flair. For those with longer hair, a side part can frame your face and add a touch of elegance or drama, depending on how deep the part is.\n\n## How to Style and Maintain the Perfect Side Part\n\n1. Heat-Free Styling Tips : Want to rock a side part without damaging your hair? Achieving the perfect part doesn’t always require heat styling tools. For curly or wavy hair, braiding your hair overnight can create a natural, heat-free wave that works well with a side part. For straighter hair, wrapping or rolling your hair while it’s damp can help create soft volume.\n2. Product Recommendations : To maintain your side part, it’s essential to use the right products. For those with fine or straight hair, a lightweight mousse or volumizing spray can add lift and texture. For curly or thicker hair, a cream or gel can help define and control the part, keeping frizz at bay while giving your style a polished finish. Look for products that offer hold without making your hair stiff or crunchy.\n3. Tools for the Job : A good comb and hairdryer are essential tools when creating a side part. A fine-tooth comb will help create a precise parting line, while a hairdryer with a nozzle attachment can help set your style in place. For those looking to create a sleek, straight side part, a flat iron is a must. But remember, less is more when it comes to heat – always use a heat protectant!\n4. Day-to-Night Versatility : The side part is perfect for transitioning from day to night. For a casual daytime look, keep the part soft and slightly undone. When heading out for an evening event, smooth down flyaways with a bit of serum and tuck one side behind your ear for a sleek, sophisticated look.\n\n## Cultural Influence on the Side Part’s Comeback\n\n1. Celebrity Endorsements : Celebrities are playing a huge role in bringing the side part back into the spotlight. From A-listers strutting the red carpet to influencers posting their looks on social media, the side part is once again becoming a go-to style for glam moments.\n2. TikTok and Gen Z Trends : Social media platforms like TikTok have reignited the debate between middle and side parts. While Gen Z was initially all about the middle part, a wave of new influencers and content creators are bringing back the side part, proving that it’s not just a millennial trend but a timeless look.\n3. Hollywood Glamour : Old-school Hollywood glamour is making a comeback, with stars channeling vintage waves and deep side parts on the red carpet. This nod to classic elegance is a major reason why the side part is making such a strong return.\n4. Nostalgic Fashion Resurgence : With the 90s and early 2000s trends back in fashion, it’s no surprise that the side part has followed suit. This nostalgic revival has made the side part a key player in today’s beauty and fashion scene.\n\n## Why the Side Part is Here to Stay in 2024\n\n1. The Middle Part Fatigue : After years of middle parts dominating the hair scene, many are turning to the side part for a fresh, dynamic look. It offers a break from the uniformity of the middle part and allows for more versatility in styling.\n2. Effortlessly Chic : The side part is effortlessly chic and requires little maintenance. Its adaptability to different hair types and styles ensures that it will remain a favourite among hairstylists and individuals alike.\n3. Complimenting Current Fashion Trends : From minimalistic fashion to romantic silhouettes, the side part pairs perfectly with current trends, adding just the right amount of structure and sophistication to any look.\n4. Workplace to Weekend : Perhaps the most compelling reason for the side part’s staying power is its versatility. Whether you’re in a corporate setting or enjoying a weekend brunch, the side part is the perfect go-to hairstyle.\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Manya Makhija](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/manya-makhija.png)\n\nManya MakhijaManya Makhija is a fashion and lifestyle writer.

    "content": "# The Best Face Moisturizers for Oily Skin: Say Goodbye to Grease\n\n> Home > Skin > Products\n\n**Author:** Manya Makhija\n**Date:** 15 Jan ‘25\n\n![Effective moisturizers for oily skin to maintain balance and prevent greasiness](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Effective%20moisturizers%20for%20oily%20skin%20to%20maintain%20balance%20and%20prevent%20greasiness_0.jpg)\n\n**Tags:** Oily skin, Moisturizer, Skincare, niacinamide, Oily Skin, Moisturizers, Skincare Ingredients, Application Tips\n\n## Keep reading to know...\n\n\n\nIf you think moisturizer isn’t for oily skin, think again! It’s a common misconception that oily skin doesn’t need hydration, but skipping this crucial step can cause your skin to overcompensate by producing even more oil. The right moisturizer can balance oil production, prevent greasy shine, and keep your skin healthy and hydrated without clogging your pores. In this guide, we’ll explore the best face moisturizers for oily skin, share tips for selecting non-comedogenic products, and highlight expert-approved application techniques to maximize their benefits.\n\n\n\n## Why Moisturizer Is Essential for Oily Skin\n\nContrary to popular belief, oily skin can be dehydrated too. When your skin lacks moisture, it can overproduce sebum to compensate, leading to clogged pores, acne, and a shiny complexion. Using a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer ensures your skin stays hydrated without feeling greasy, keeping your complexion balanced and healthy.\n\n## Benefits of Moisturizer for Oily Skin\n\n* Balances Oil Production: Prevents overproduction of sebum by keeping your skin hydrated.\n* Reduces Breakouts: Non-comedogenic moisturizer formulas won’t clog pores, reducing acne risk.\n* Improves Texture: Hydration minimizes the appearance of large pores and smoothens the skin.\n* Supports Barrier Function: Strengthens your skin’s moisture barrier, preventing external irritants from causing damage.\n\n## Top Ingredients to Look For\n\nFinding the best moisturizer cream for oily skin involves knowing what ingredients to embrace and avoid.\n\n**Hero Ingredients**\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid: A lightweight hydrator that attracts water to the skin without adding oil.\n* Niacinamide: Balances sebum production and soothes inflammation.\n* Aloe Vera: Calms and hydrates skin while being non-greasy.\n* Salicylic Acid: Controls oil and keeps pores clear.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Ingredients to Avoid**\n\n* Heavy Oils: Such as coconut oil or mineral oil, which can clog pores.\n* Synthetic Fragrances: Can irritate sensitive, oily skin.\n* Silicones: May create a slippery feel but can lead to clogged pores over time.\n\n## The Best Moisturizers for Oily Skin\n\nHere’s a curated list of top-performing moisturizers that deliver hydration without the shine.\n\n1. Simple Protecting Light Moisturiser (125 ml): This lightweight moisturizer is ideal for daytime use, offering SPF protection while keeping skin hydrated. Its non-comedogenic formula ensures no clogged pores, making it perfect for oily and combination skin.\n2. Simple Ultra-Light Liquid Moisturiser (60 ml): With its water-like texture, this moisturizer sinks into the skin instantly, leaving no residue. It’s a fantastic choice for those who prefer ultra-light hydration.\n3. Novology Moisture Barrier Booster - Cream: Designed to strengthen the skin’s barrier, this cream is perfect for nighttime use. Its blend of ceramides and probiotics works to repair and protect the skin while controlling oiliness.\n4. Dove Men Face Moisturiser - Oil: Control Specially formulated for men, this moisturizer offers all-day oil control and hydration. It’s perfect for combating shine while keeping the skin soft and smooth.\n\n## Application Tips for Maximum Benefits\n\nUsing the best face moisturizer for oily skin isn’t enough—you need to apply it the right way for optimal results.\n\n1. Prep Your Skin: Start with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, oil, and makeup. Follow with a toner to balance your skin’s pH and tighten pores.\n2. Use the Right Amount: A pea-sized amount of moisturizer is usually sufficient for your entire face. Over-applying can overwhelm your skin and lead to a greasy feel.\n3. Layer Correctly: Apply moisturizer after serums but before sunscreen in the morning. For nighttime, it’s the last step after any treatments or serums.\n4. Customize for Day and Night: Opt for lightweight gel or SPF-infused moisturizers during the day, and richer, repairing formulas at night to support your skin’s recovery process.\n\n## Special Considerations: Matching Moisturizers to Your Skin’s Needs\n\nNot all oily skin is the same. Tailoring your moisturizer to your specific needs ensures you get the best results.\n\n* Combination Skin: Use a lightweight moisturizer on oilier areas and slightly richer products on drier patches.\n* Acne-Prone Skin: Choose non-comedogenic, oil-free formulas to hydrate without triggering breakouts.\n* Sensitive Skin: Stick to gentle, fragrance-free moisturizers like the Simple Protecting Light Moisturiser to avoid irritation.\n\n## Men vs. Women: Are Moisturizer Needs Different?\n\nWhile both men and women need hydration and oil control, their skincare preferences and habits often differ.\n\n* For Men Men: tend to have thicker, oilier skin, making lightweight, oil-controlling moisturizers like Dove Men Face Moisturiser a practical choice.\n* For Women: Women might prefer multitasking products like Simple Protecting Light Moisturiser for daytime SPF and Novology Moisture Barrier Booster for nighttime repair.\n* Unisex Picks: The Simple Ultra-Light Liquid Moisturiser works universally, delivering effective hydration without feeling heavy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMoisturizing is a vital step in every skincare routine, even for those with oily skin. The key lies in choosing the right product—lightweight, oil-free, and packed with skin-loving ingredients. Whether you’re looking to balance oil, reduce breakouts, or improve texture, incorporating the best face moisturizer for oily skin into your routine can transform your complexion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Manya Makhija](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/manya-makhija.png)\n\nManya MakhijaManya Makhija is a fashion and lifestyle writer.

    "content": "# How to Use Glycolic Acid Serum: The Glow Booster That Works Without Freaking Out Your Skin\n\n*Want to get that bright complexion? Learn how to use glycolic acid serum in this guide with expert tips from two leading dermatologists in India*\n\n> Home > Skin > Products\n\n**Author:** Praneet Sahni Kalani\n**Date:** 21 Jan ‘25\n\n![Complete guide to using glycolic acid serum for healthier, glowing skin](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Complete%20guide%20to%20using%20glycolic%20acid%20serum%20for%20healthier%2C%20glowing%20skin_0.png)\n\n**Tags:** Glycolic Acid, Exfoliation, Skincare Routine, Anti-aging, Benefits, Application, Products\n\n## Keep reading to know...\n\n\n\nExfoliation – a fundamental ritual of any skincare routine, involves using chemical exfoliants like glycolic acid for a gentle yet deep cleanse. What is glycolic acid, you may ask? It’s a water-soluble alpha-hydroxy acid that is widely used in skincare products. What makes it special is that it absorbs into the skin and exfoliates better than other AHAs. It has also been proven ideal for smoothing fine lines, improving skin texture and targeting other anti-aging issues. **<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dr.manasi.skin/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Manasi Shirolikar</a>**, a board-certified dermatologist with over a decade of experience shares, “glycolic acid is a multitasker that can be used on the face and on the body to help remove tanning. It can also reduce the appearance of keratosis pilaris and can also be used on the scalp to reduce flaking.”\n\nUsing <a href=\"https://www.bebeautiful.in/all-things-skin/everyday/perfect-serum-for-your-skin-to-%20%20%20fight-aging\" target=\"_blank\">glycolic acid serum</a> correctly is essential to maximize its benefits while keeping your skin happy and healthy. In this article, we’ll explore how to use glycolic acid serum and seamlessly incorporate it into your skincare routine, with tips from top dermatologists to guide you every step of the way.\n\n\n\n## Benefits of Glycolic Acid For The Skin\n\nGlycolic acid has a myriad of benefits, including:\n\n1. Reduced dead skin cells and bacteria.\n2. Smoother, brighter skin with reduced pigmentation, melasma and age spots. It also helps to minimize discolouration and sun damage.\n3. Improved texture and skin tone as a result of exfoliation.\n4. Increased cell turnover due to enhanced collagen production.\n5. Minimise pores and breakout prevention.\n6. Hydrated, plump skin with a more youthful appearance.\n\n## What Form of Glycolic Acid is Best?\n\nThe best way to get the maximum benefits of glycolic acid is by using it in a serum form as serums are made with potent formulations and absorb quickly into the skin. Serums have a higher concentration of glycolic acid, so it’s better to start in small amounts. To understand glycolic acid better, here are some do’s and don’ts as guided by experts.\n\n## Some Do’s And Don’ts of Applying Glycolic Acid Serum Every Day\n\n**<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drkiransays/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Kiran</a>**, India’s renowned cosmetic dermatologist and founder of **<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/isyaderm/\" target=\"_blank\">Isya Derm</a>** explains that glycolic acid serum can be used every day, albeit with a break once a week, and only if your skin is not thin or sensitive. Dr Manasi shares some more do’s and don’ts.\n\n**Do's**\n\n1. Start slow with 1–2 times a week, especially if you’re a beginner.\n\n2. Always patch-test before full-face application.\n\n3. Apply on clean, dry skin for maximum absorption.\n\n4. Follow up with a hydrating moisturizer and sunscreen during the day.\n\n**Donts's**\n\n1. Avoid applying it every day initially, as overuse can compromise the skin barrier.\n\n2. Don’t combine it with strong actives like retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or Vitamin C in the same routine.\n\n3. Skip exfoliating scrubs or harsh cleansers when using glycolic acid to prevent over-exfoliation.\n\nWe recommend using **<a href=\"https://www.lakmeindia.com/products/lakme-glycolic-illuminate-serum-with-1-glycolic-acid-reduces-dullness-improves-texture?srsltid=AfmBOop-BKD_tUUAgcTKIBqf5KhCRqLh1r855ydXafJaX9QKkaPOCxWd\" target=\"_blank\">Lakme Glycolic Illuminate Serum with 1% Glycolic Acid</a>**. This one reduces dullness and improves texture allowing your skin to feel luxurious. When using any glycolic acid serum, a rule of thumb is to always hydrate and protect your skin with sunscreen, if using during the day. Both Dr Kiran and Dr Manasi suggest that in fact it’s best to use it in the PM routine to minimize sun sensitivity.\n\n## How Can You Incorporate Glycolic Acid Serum in Your Skincare Routine?\n\n**Step 1**: You can begin by **choosing a low concentration serum** to ease your skin into using it. Start by using it 1-2 times a week, allowing your skin to adapt and gradually increase to 3-4 times per week if your skin tolerates it well. Don’t forget to patch test first.\n\n**Step 2**: **Cleanse your skin** with a gentle, non-stripping cleanser to remove dirt and oils from your face. This prepares your skin for better absorption of the glycolic acid.\n\n**Step 3**: **Use Glycolic Acid at night**, as it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.\n\n**Step 4**: Glycolic acid can be drying, so **follow up with a hydrating**, non-comedogenic moisturizer to replenish the skin’s barrier. I’d say look for products containing soothing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or aloe vera.\n\n## Using Glycolic Acid with Other Ingredients\n\nCertain ingredients work better with glycolic acid than others. Dr Kiran suggests using glycolic acid with vitamin C. “This pair works wonderfully because both are low pH and work synergistically.” On the other hand, Dr Manasi advises combining ceramides with glycolic acid. “As an exfoliant, glycolic acid causes removal of dead skin cells that make up the outermost layer of your skin barrier. Using a ceramide based product will help to reinforce this skin barrier.” More combinations that work well are:\n\n* Glycolic acid and retinol: These ingredients are extremely powerful and should only be used together if you have very tolerant skin.\n* Glycolic acid and hyaluronic acid: Since hyaluronic acid loads up skin with moisture, it makes for an excellent pairing with glycolic acid.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGlycolic acid is one of the most powerful ingredients in skin care. If you’re looking to keep your skin looking clean with fewer breakouts and a smooth texture, then glycolic acid is what you need. In fact, you’ll notice that your makeup will glide through better and require less product to cover up spots. Give this exfoliating power ingredient a try and see for yourself how it makes your skin feel.\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Praneet Sahni Kalani](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/praneet-kalani.png)\n\nPraneet Sahni KalaniPraneet Sahni Kalani is a fashion & lifestyle writer.

Here’s why you need to incorporate a vitamin C face wash into your daily skincare routine.*\n\n> Home > Skin > Products\n\n**Author:** Pallavi Mehra\n**Date:** 20 Jan ‘25\n\n![Vitamin C face wash for glowing, refreshed, and younger-looking skin](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Vitamin%20C%20face%20wash%20for%20glowing%2C%20refreshed%2C%20and%20younger-looking%20skin_0.png)\n\n**Tags:** vitamin C, Face Wash, Skincare, Skin Benefits, Vitamin C, Skincare tips\n\n## Keep reading to know...\n\n\n\nVitamin C, a potent antioxidant, renowned for its brightening prowess, offers numerous benefits to your skin health when incorporated into your daily routine. Undoubtedly, serums are the most common type of vitamin C product. However, often overshadowed by its serum counterpart, vitamin C face washes are quietly emerging as a skincare hero. In this guide, we’ll explain why a vitamin C face wash is a must-have for brightening your skin and fighting signs of ageing. We’ll cover its antioxidant properties, how it fights dullness, and how to incorporate it into your daily skincare routine for a fresh, glowing complexion. Bookmark this article to achieve radiant skin, and thank us later!\n\n\n\n## Vitamin C Benefits For Skin\n\nA cornerstone of any effective brightening skincare routine, vitamin C acts as a melanin inhibitor. By effectively curbing the overproduction of this pigment, responsible for the appearance of dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and an uneven complexion, <a href=\"https://www.bebeautiful.in/all-things-skin/everyday/benefits-of-vitamin-c-in-skincare\" target=\"_blank\">vitamin C benefits for skin</a> contributes significantly to a brighter and youthful-looking complexion.\n\n## Vitamin C Face Wash Benefits: Beyond Brightening\n\nVitamin C excels at illuminating dull skin, fading age spots, and naturally boosting collagen, making it integral for maintaining youthful radiance as time progresses. In particular, vitamin C face washes offer the following benefits:\n\n1. Combats Ageing: Vitamin C's antioxidant power isn't just about brightening. It acts as a strong shield against environmental aggressors such as pollution and UV radiation, neutralising free radicals that result in premature ageing.\n2. A Wake-Up Call for Dull Skin: Dullness often stems from a buildup of dead skin cells. Vitamin C slowly exfoliates, revealing a brighter, more radiant complexion.\n3. Boosting Collagen Production: Collagen, the key to resilient skin, reduces with age. Vitamin C stimulates collagen synthesis, promoting firmer, more youthful skin.\n4. Sun Damage Repair: It helps repair existing sun damage and shield against future damage.\n5. Wound Healing: Vitamin C aids in wound healing and tissue repair.\n6. Anti-inflammatory: It minimises inflammation and redness associated with breakouts and other skin issues.\n\n## How To Use Vitamin C Face Washes?\n\nTo help you get started, here are some easy-to-follow steps to incorporate vitamin C face washes into your daily skincare routine:\n\n1. **Morning and Night**: For best results, cleanse with your vitamin C face wash both morning and evening.\n\n2. **Gentle Massage**: Gently massage the vitamin C face wash onto damp skin, focusing on areas prone to dullness.\n\n3. **Rinse Thoroughly**: Wash off with lukewarm water and pat your face dry with a clean towel.\n\n4. **Follow Up**: Follow with your favourite vitamin C serum and moisturiser to maximise benefits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you’re using vitamin C face washes for the first time, keep in mind the following expert-approved tips:\n\n1. **Begin Slowly**: If you have sensitive skin, choose a vitamin C face wash with a lower concentration. Moreover, regardless of the sensitivity of your skin, a patch test of new ingredients is always advisable.\n\n2. **Always Wear Sunscreen**: Follow up with a broad-spectrum sunscreen, as vitamin C increases sun sensitivity in some individuals.\n\n3. **Consume Vitamin C-rich Foods**: While you can see results with a good vitamin C face wash, don't forget about the power of food. Experts state that eating plenty of citrus fruits, bell peppers, and other vitamin C-rich foods will help your skin glow from the inside out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nVitamin C face washes are a great addition to any skincare routine. Its ability to brighten, shield, and repair makes it a true multi-tasker. Embrace the power of this potent antioxidant and unlock a brighter, more youthful complexion.\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Pallavi Mehra](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/pallavi-mehra.png)\n\nPallavi MehraPallavi Mehra writes about lifestyle, culture and beauty, finding inspiration from her immediate environment or her travels around the world.

Add to it acne prone skin that demands finding the right face cleanser for acne and a skincare routine that focuses on how to get rid of pimples – in this case, skin care doesn’t feel relaxing anymore. Skin care literally means caring for the skin and I don’t think this routine should be rushed or stressed about. Lucky for you, we spoke to three renowned dermatologists across the country to bring to you a comprehensive guide to creating an effective skincare routine for pimples. Read ahead to find out essential steps, starting with the basics of cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturising, with expert recommendations for targeted treatments for acne-prone skin. Find out some common skincare mistakes that you may be making and make your way to clearer, healthier skin starting this new year. Consider these tips your jackpot straight from experts.\n\n\n\n## Morning Skincare Routine for Pimple\n\n**Dr Jaishree Sharad**, one of the leading dermatologists in Mumbai, suggests opting for cleansers with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. **Dr Kiran Sethi**, another leading cosmetic dermatologist and founder of **<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/isyaderm/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Isya Aesthetics</a>** asserts the same. She adds, “I believe in grading the zits and understanding the level of acne.” For a layman, your best bet is to start with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide and then of course, consult your dermatologist. “You can also consider using niacinamide and green tea in case your skin is very oily.”\n\nThe promise of youthful skin well into my senior years is reason enough to get my skin care routine sorted ASAP. **Dr Madhuri Agarwal** a board certified dermatologist and the founder of **<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yavanaaestheticclinic/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Yavana Aesthetic</a>** advises using a foamy or gel cleanser twice a day to remove dirt and oil and unclog pores. She also attests to using ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to cleanse well. “Avoid frequent washing of the face in the daytime.”\n\n**<a href=\"https://www.novology.com/products/acne-reduction-cleanser\" target=\"_blank\">Novology’s Acne Deep Clearing Cleanser</a>** is a trusted face wash for achieving clearer skin in just six washes. Its gentle, lightweight gel formula cleanses without stripping moisture. It contains Thymol and Terpineol to target only acne-causing bacteria. It’s basically your solution to treating active acne, blackheads, and whiteheads, giving you smooth, hydrated, and squeaky clean skin.\n\nI was convinced that sunscreen was all I needed to achieve a golden, baby-smooth, skin. Let’s face it, sunscreen is a godsend product for addressing anti-aging, preventing and reducing dark spots, and offering protection from the sun. However, over the years and after many mistakes, I've learned that it’s the big guns—targeted serums, gentle cleansers, hydrating moisturisers—that really do the heavy lifting. A serum with niacinamide can help with inflammation and to control excess oil production. You can pair your facewash with **<a href=\"https://www.novology.com/products/acne-reduction-serum?srsltid=AfmBOoowzEWLNeuUDIMh8ItX-QhGytRmNL-qGtTWxAdBw2BuOWUn4G2Y\" target=\"_blank\">Novology Acne Clearing Serum</a>**. It’s a non-sticky formulation that fights acne while preserving beneficial bacteria and restoring your skin’s natural balance.\n\nFace creams are the third step. Use a lightweight, water based, **<a href=\"https://www.bebeautiful.in/all-things-skin/products/non-comedogenic-moisturizers\" target=\"_blank\">non-comedogenic moisturiser</a>** to hydrate your skin. Don’t forget, even oily skin needs moisturising to prevent sudden drying or irritation of skin. Look for products with glycerine, hyaluronic acid, panthenol, bisabol, niacinamide.\n\nSunscreen is the last step. On choosing the best sunscreen for your face, look for an SPF 30 or higher. Sunscreen is very important irrespective of acne. Dr Jaishree adds, “most of the acne patients are on retinoids which increases skin’s sensitivity to the sun. Opt for an oil-free/gel-based sunscreen to avoid clogging of pores.” Dr Madhuri recommends going for a sunscreen with silicones as it helps achieve a nice glow. “Physical sunscreens are also a good option preferable with tint to avoid the white cast with zinc.”\n\n## Night Skincare Routine for Pimple\n\nThe primary focus in the evening, before going to bed, is to prep your skin so that it can repair and rejuvenate to the best of its ability. Like the morning routine, the night routine starts with cleansing, followed by a restorative and calming eye cream, serum if needed and a moisturiser to lock it all in.\n\nTake the day off with the same cleanser you used in the morning. If you have makeup on, double cleanse with an oil based cleanser first, followed by your regular face wash. You can try **<a href=\"https://dermalogica.in/products/precleanse-cleansing-oil-makeup-remover\" target=\"_blank\">Dermalogica’s Precleanse Cleansing Oil &amp; Makeup Remover</a>**, which is also Allure’s Best of Beauty Award Winner. It’ll thoroughly melt away layers of excess sebum (oil), sunscreen, waterproof make-up, environmental pollutants and residual products that build up on skin throughout the day.\n\nYou can gauge how your skin is feeling and the kind of day you’ve had, coupled with when was the last time you exfoliated. Exfoliating too often, like every day, is also not advisable. You can choose to do it every two days, depending on your lifestyle. Dr Madhuri suggests using a chemical acid exfoliator containing salicylic or glycolic acid twice or thrice a week to minimise the dead cell plugging of the pores. Oily skin has a thicker and larger pore lining. This can cause more buildup in the pores.\n\nYou can try **<a href=\"https://www.novology.com/products/acne-spot-corrector-gel\" target=\"_blank\">Novology’s Acne Rescue Spot Corrector</a>** that is patented with TT2 technology with 0.10% Thymol and Terpineol. Dr Jaishree recommends applying benzoyl peroxide/retinoid (adapalene or tretinoin)/ salicylic acid/ topical antibiotic or a combination of any of these ingredients as spot treatment for active acne.\n\nFinish the routine with a moisturiser. This can be the same one that you use in the day time. I personally like to use one with bakuchiol, a plant-based alternative to retinol. Bakuchiol can help with acne by reducing blemishes, unclogging pores, and regulating oil production.\n\n## Dermatologist Recommended Targeted Treatments For Acne-Prone Skin\n\nSome common treatments that all three dermatologists advocate:\n\n1. Oral medication: Antibiotics and vitamin A derivatives are prescribed according to the grade of acne and patient profile\n2. Topical Creams/Gels/ Patches: These usually contain salicylic acid, tretinoin, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, dapsone, among others.\n3. Chemical Peeling: Using various concentrations of salicylic acid peel helps to reduce acne. Other peels used in dermatology clinics are: Black peel, Mandelic peel, TCA Peel, and more.\n4. Blue Light Therapy: Uses specific wavelengths of light to destroy bacteria and also reduces inflammation. Blue light therapy can also be done at home.\n5. Microneedling: Useful for scarring as well as active breakouts.\n6. Microdermabrasion: Helps to reduce clogged pores and grade 2 acne.\n\n## How Long Should You Wait to See The Results?\n\nDr Jaishree confirms that results typically depend on the type and grade of acne, the active ingredients in the products you are using, hormonal imbalance if any, lifestyle and compliance with the treatment. “4-6 weeks is an ideal time to devote to a fixed morning and night pimple control skin care routine. If there is no improvement after 6 weeks, you must consult a dermatologist.” Dr Madhuri adds that severe pimples can take up to 6-9 months to heal and settle down.\n\n## Common Skincare Mistakes to Avoid\n\nIf you’re wondering why you’re not able to see the best results when you’re possibly doing a lot of self-care and skin care – there’s a chance that you might be making some of these skincare mistakes.\n\n1. Over-cleansing and under-cleansing\n2. Using comedogenic products\n3. Incomplete makeup removal and heavy makeup coverage\n4. Not moisturising enough\n5. Untreated dandruff\n6. Undiagnosed hormonal issues\n7. Neglecting lifestyle factors like reducing stress, lack of exercise, smoking, disturbed sleep cycle and an unhealthy diet are the most common.\n8. Ø Touching your face too often with unclean hands\n9. Picking and squeezing acne\n10. Skipping sunscreen in the skin care routine\n\n## Final Takeaway\n\nWhile ingredients like niacinamide (Vitamin B3), salicylic acid, tea tree oil, vitamin C and zinc are excellent for day time, ingredients best suited for the night are retinoids, clay masks and glycolic acid. You can switch up your products based on these ingredients for day and night. Largely, a simple **<a href=\"https://www.bebeautiful.in/all-things-skin/everyday/simplify-your-skin-care-routine\" target=\"_blank\">skincare routine</a>** must be followed to treat acne. Incorporating these ingredients, along with ensuring that you avoid some common mistakes can take you closer to clearer skin.\n\n## Meet The Dermatologists:\n\n1.

The **<a href=\"https://www.lakmeindia.com/products/lakme-absolute-blur-perfect-primer?srsltid=AfmBOoqG9i8OQjKztTZPDNdx0HSTFugY19OyeU4L493jy6OOBkhAoIMv\" target=\"_blank\">Lakmé Absolute Blur Perfect Makeup Primer</a>** is a game-changer for brides aiming for a seamless, long-lasting finish. Its velvety texture not only minimizes the appearance of pores but also creates a smooth canvas for foundation, ensuring your makeup stays intact through emotional pheras and high-energy dance floors.\n\n**Why It’s Essential:**\n\nIndian weddings are marathons, not sprints. From the early morning rituals to the late-night celebrations, your makeup needs to stand the test of time—and the elements. Steps of makeup like prepping your skin with a hydrating primer, choosing a long-wear foundation, and setting your look with a finishing spray help lock in your look, keeping your skin fresh and radiant even after hours under the spotlight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 2: Defining Your Eyes + Eyeshadow**\n\n**<img alt=\"Kajal\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-02/Kajal.png\">**\n\nThe eyes are often the focal point of an Indian bridal look. **<a href=\"https://www.lakmeindia.com/products/lakme-eyeconic-kajal-twin-pack-0-35g-0-35g?srsltid=AfmBOoqRQbkh-bYo9RnPS0wRlNqgQooZfrujhGsH3kDSmaJF3LKa_U6P\" target=\"_blank\">The Lakmé Eyeconic Kajal</a>** is your ultimate tool for achieving that mesmerizing gaze, versatile enough for both traditional and modern aesthetics.\n\n**For Traditional Looks:** Use the kajal to create bold, kohl-rimmed eyes that exude timeless elegance. Pair it with golden or bronze eyeshadow to enhance the depth and warmth of your eyes, complementing your lehenga or saree.\n\n**For Contemporary Styles:** Wing it out for a sleek, cat-eye effect, or smudge it along the lash line for a soft, smokey vibe that adds an edge to your bridal ensemble.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Eyeshadow:**\n\n**<img alt=\"Eyeshadow\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-02/Eyeshadow.png\">**\n\nStart with a neutral base like champagne or soft pink for a fresh daytime look. For evening weddings, go bolder with golds, bronzes, or even rich jewel tones like emerald or ruby for a luxe effect. Blend your eyeshadow to create depth and dimension. Add shimmer or glitter to the eyelids for a more dramatic, festive touch that catches the light beautifully.\n\n**Pro Tip:To make your eyes pop, apply a light, shimmery eyeshadow to the inner corners of your eyes and under the brow bone. This gives your eyes a brighter, more awake look.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 3: Contouring**\n\n**<img alt=\"Contour\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-02/Contour.png\">**\n\nTo define your face, apply a contour powder or cream along your cheekbones, jawline, and temples. This will give your face a sculpted, radiant look, balancing the strong eye makeup. Blend well to avoid harsh lines for a more natural finish.\n\n**Pro Tip:Tightline your eyes with the kajal for an amplified yet natural definition that makes your lashes look fuller.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 4: Achieving a Radiant Complexion**\n\n**<img alt=\"Foundation\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-02/Foundation.png\">**\n\nIndian bridal makeup is synonymous with glowing skin—a look that strikes a delicate balance between dewy freshness and long-lasting coverage.

Blend the mousse seamlessly into your skin and add a touch of the **<a href=\"https://www.lakmeindia.com/products/lakme-9-to-5-complexion-care-face-cream?srsltid=AfmBOooyhubKgSTsciuQ-CSdoE8AV56t_mnj-DyFum-axdJlbZT--O7_\" target=\"_blank\">Lakmé 9 to 5 Complexion Care Face Cream in Bronze</a>** for a warm, sun-kissed glow. This combination ensures your skin looks healthy and luminous in natural light.\n\n**For Evening Celebrations:** Layer the mousse for more coverage and top it with a setting powder to avoid unwanted shine under artificial lighting. The result? A complexion that looks flawless both in person and on camera.\n\nPair the base with Lakme Facelift Multislayer Contour Stick to highlight your cheekbones for a more glamorous, chic look.\n\n**Pro Tip: Blend foundation into your neck and décolletage for a uniform finish that enhances your entire bridal look.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 5: Bold Lips That Speak Volumes**\n\n**<img alt=\"Bold-lips\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-02/Bold-lips.png\">**\n\nA bride’s lips are her statement piece, often playing a pivotal role in defining the overall look. Deep reds, rich maroons, and berry tones are timeless favorites, while modern brides are increasingly experimenting with unconventional shades like coral or dusty rose. Steps for makeup such as exfoliating the lips, applying a hydrating balm, lining with a lip pencil for definition, and layering lipstick with a touch of gloss ensure the lips stay vibrant and flawless throughout the celebrations.\n\n**How to Make It Last:** Prep your lips with a hydrating balm, then outline them with a lip liner to prevent feathering. Opt for a matte finish for long-lasting wear—perfect for everything from the sindoor ceremony to those endless post-wedding selfies.\n\n**Balancing Act:** If your eyes are bold and dramatic, choose a more understated lip color to let them shine. Conversely, if your eye makeup is soft and subtle, don’t hesitate to go bold with your lips for a striking contrast.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 6: The Golden Glow: Highlighting and Accentuating Features**\n\n**<img alt=\"Highlighter\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-02/Highlighter.png\">**\n\nGolden tones are synonymous with Indian wedding makeup looks, adding a touch of regal elegance to any look. Whether it’s a highlighter on your cheekbones or a golden shimmer on your eyelids, these accents tie your makeup together beautifully.\n\n**Where to Highlight:** Focus on the high points of your face—cheekbones, brow bones, the bridge of your nose, and your cupid’s bow. For an extra touch of glamour, dust some highlighter across your collarbones and shoulders, especially if your outfit features an off-shoulder neckline.\n\n**Golden Eyes:** Pair gold eyeshadow with the **<a href=\"https://www.lakmeindia.com/products/lakme-eyeconic-kajal-twin-pack-0-35g-0-35g?srsltid=AfmBOoqRQbkh-bYo9RnPS0wRlNqgQooZfrujhGsH3kDSmaJF3LKa_U6P\" target=\"_blank\">Lakmé Eyeconic Kajal</a>** for a look that’s traditional yet modern. Blend it into the inner corners of your eyes to make them pop.\n\n**Pro Tip: Layering is key. Build your highlight gradually to avoid an overly shiny finish, ensuring a sophisticated, lit-from-within glow. And don’t forget to finish your look with the Lakme Absolute Made To Last Setting Spray for a lasting, no-smudge look!**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step 7: Setting Spray for a Long-Lasting Finish**\n\n**<img alt=\"setting-spray\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-02/setting-spray.png\">**\n\nFinally, seal your bridal look with the **Lakmé Absolute Made To Last Setting Spray**. This essential step locks in your makeup, ensuring that it stays fresh, smudge-free, and flawless through hours of celebrations, photos, and dances.\n\n**Pro Tip: Hold the setting spray at arm's length and mist over your face in a \"T\" and \"X\" motion for even coverage. Let it dry naturally to ensure a perfect, long-lasting finish.**\n\n## Seasonal Trends to Elevate Your Bridal Look\n\nIndian weddings span seasons, and your wedding makeup should adapt to the weather while still looking stunning.\n\n**Summer Weddings**: Opt for lightweight, waterproof formulas. The **<a href=\"https://www.lakmeindia.com/products/lakme-absolute-blur-perfect-primer?srsltid=AfmBOopCry34kgZGgIwD4l50cjLrphF-lhsbLUBujSGlGlqNy89PziDv\" target=\"_blank\">Lakmé Absolute Blur Perfect Makeup Primer</a>** paired with a setting spray will help keep your makeup intact even in humid conditions.\n\n**Winter Weddings**: Go for hydrating foundations and creamy blushes to counteract dryness, giving your skin a dewy finish.

Whether you’re inspired by classic Bollywood brides or modern minimalist trends, customization is key. Experiment with elements like dual-tone eyeshadows, ombre lips, or even colored liners to make your look one-of-a-kind.\n\nUltimately, the best bridal makeup is the one that makes you feel like the most radiant version of yourself. With these tips and products—each designed to enhance your natural beauty—you’ll be ready to take on your big day with confidence, style, and grace.\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Keerat Kohli](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/Keerat%20Kohli.png)\n\nKeerat KohliKeerat Kohli is a beauty and lifestyle writer who often boasts her expertise as the self-proclaimed beauty guru of her friend group.

    "content": "# Best Haircuts for Round Faces: Dos, Don’ts, and Must-Trys\n\n> Home > Hair > Haircuts By Face Shape\n\n**Author:** Alvira Dsouza\n**Date:** 30 Jan ‘25\n\n![Stylish-haircut-for-round-face-shapes-for-a-trendy-polished-look](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Stylish-haircut-for-round-face-shapes-for-a-trendy%2C-polished-look_0.png)\n\n**Tags:** Haircuts, Round Face, Hairstyles, Maintenance, RoundFace, Layers, Bangs\n\n## Keep reading to know...\n\n\n\nAlright, bestie, let’s talk hair — because we’re not here to blend in, okay? Picking the wrong haircut for a round face can make it look wider than your fave pizza slice, but the right cut? Total slay. Whether you’re dreaming of a <a href=\"https://bebeautiful.in/all-things-hair/everyday/everything-you-need-to-know-about-curtain-bangs\" target=\"_blank\">curtain bangs haircut</a> or a layered glow-up, keep scrolling because we’re about to serve the ultimate guide to the best haircut for a round face. Let’s make those angles pop and give you main character energy.\n\n\n\n## How to Tell If You Have a Round Face\n\n**<img alt=\"round-face\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/round-face.jpg\">**\n\nFirst, the basics. A round face usually has:\n\n* Equal width and length with soft, rounded edges (think: super cute).\n* Cheeks that are poppin’ with fullness.\n* A jawline that’s more \"adorable teddy bear\" than \"sharp-as-a-knife.\"\n\n## Cuts That Eat: Best Haircuts for Round Faces\n\n**1. Layered Cuts**\n\n**<img alt=\"round-face\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/round-face.jpg\">**\n\nThink layers, but make them iconic. Layers break up the roundness and add structure, giving your face that snatched look. Long, face-framing layers that start below the chin? Chef’s kiss.\n\n**Pro Tip: Pair your layers with a deep side part for an extra touch of asymmetry and drama. Slay all day.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2. Curtain Bangs Haircut**\n\n**<img alt=\"curtain-bangs\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/curtain-bangs.png\">**\n\nCurtain bangs are the blueprint for effortless cool-girl vibes. These swoopy bangs frame your face, creating the illusion of length. Plus, they’re perfect for anyone who wants bangs without committing to a full-on blunt fringe.\n\n**Pro Tip: Blow them out with a round brush and a dab of styling cream to get that soft, airy effect.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3. Long, Sleek Hair**\n\n**<img alt=\"long-sleek\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/long-sleek.png\">**\n\nLet’s get one thing straight: sleek, shiny hair is always in. Long, pin-straight locks elongate your face and balance its proportions. Bonus? It’s giving CEO, it’s giving boss vibes.\n\n**Pro Tip: Shine serum + flat iron = your new BFFs for this look.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**4. Asymmetrical Bob**\n\n**<img alt=\"asymmetrical-bob\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/asymmetrical-bob.png\">**\n\nThe asymmetrical bob is edgy, chic, and flattering—a triple threat. Shorter in the back and longer in the front, it’s basically the contour of haircuts. Plus, it’s a low-maintenance style with maximum impact.\n\n**Pro Tip: Tuck one side behind your ear and let the other side shine. Iconic**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**5. Shag Haircuts**\n\n**<img alt=\"shaggy\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/shaggy.png\">**\n\nShag cuts scream \"I woke up like this.\" They’re messy in the best way, with choppy layers that add height and slim down your face. Think rockstar meets supermodel off-duty.\n\n**Pro Tip: Hit it with sea salt spray for that \"beach day but make it fashion\" texture.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**6. The Soft Wolf Cut**\n\n**<img alt=\"Soft-wolf-cut\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Soft-wolf-cut.png\">**\n\nThis trendy haircut blends shaggy layers with a soft, tapered look that flatters round faces. The secret is in the feathery ends and face-framing layers that elongate your features while giving off a playful, lived-in vibe.\n\n**Styling trick: Use a texturizing spray or a lightweight mousse, scrunch your hair, and air dry for effortless texture. And for extra volume, flip your hair upside down while blow-drying and tousle it lightly for a chic, undone finish – Pamela Anderson approved of this.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**7. Bold Pixie with Side Fringe**\n\n**<img alt=\"Bold-Pixie-with-Side-Fringe\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Bold-Pixie-with-Side-Fringe.png\">**\n\nThe bold pixie now comes with a side fringe to break the roundness of your face and highlight your cheekbones. The jaw-grazing length creates structure, while subtle layers add personality.\n\n**Styling trick: Apply a pea-sized amount of styling wax to your fingers and work it through your fringe and crown for a piecey, edgy finish. Also, smooth the fringe with a flat iron and tuck one side behind your ear for sophistication.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**8. Layered Lob with Wavy Ends**\n\n**<img alt=\"Layered-Lob-with-Wavy-Ends\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Layered-Lob-with-Wavy-Ends.png\">**\n\nThe layered lob offers a flattering balance for round faces by elongating the look of your jawline. Subtle waves at the ends create movement and give it a carefree feel.\n\n**Styling trick: Wrap sections of your hair around a flat iron, moving away from the face for soft, effortless waves. Rake through the curls with your fingers and finish with a shine-enhancing serum or spray for that perfect glossy, beachy texture.**\n\n## The Nope, Abort! Cuts: Haircuts to Avoid for Round Face\n\n**1. Blunt Bangs**: These are the mean girls of haircuts for round faces. They cut your face in half, making it look shorter and wider. Swipe left.\n\n**2. Chin-Length Bobs**: A bob that stops at your chin? It’s giving \"extra round.\" Go for a lob (long bob) instead—it’s more flattering.\n\n**3. One-Length Cuts**: Flat, one-length hair is like a bad IG filter—it does nothing for you. Opt for layers or angles instead.\n\n**4. Tight Curls by Your Cheeks**: Curls are cute, but if they’re too tight and close to your cheeks, they’ll emphasize the roundness. Loosen it up, babe.\n\n**5. Center Parts**: Middle parts are trending, but they’re not always friendly to round faces. A deep side part adds more drama and balances your look.\n\n## Mane-tainence Tips: How to Care and Maintain the Fresh Cut\n\nLet’s keep it real—a cute cut is nothing without good maintenance. Here’s how to keep your hair on point:\n\n* Regular Trims: Snip those ends every 6-8 weeks.\n* Hydrate Like a Pro: Use a conditioner that’ll keep your strands silky. Also, do not over-condition your hair strands as it can get sloppy and almost greasy too quickly. Use the pea drop measurement for the best-balanced use of conditioning your mane.\n* Heat Protectant: Always. No excuses.\n* Embrace the Chill: Don’t overdo it with styling tools. Let your natural texture shine.\n\n## Final Thoughts:\n\nPicking the best haircut for a round face is all about playing with length, layers, and angles. Curtain bangs, asymmetrical bobs, or shag cuts? All yes. Blunt bangs or chin-length bobs? Hard pass. Remember, the goal is to elongate and define—but also have fun with it. Hair grows back, so why not try something bold?\n\nAt Be Beautiful, we’re your hype squad for all things beauty. Now go book that salon appointment and walk out like the main character you are.

    "content": "# The Ultimate Guide to Choosing the Perfect Face Wash for Combination Skin\n\n*The face wash guide you didn’t know you needed. Read on to find out your right pick.*\n\n> Home > Skin > Products\n\n**Author:** Praneet Sahni Kalani\n**Date:** 07 Jan ‘25\n\n![Top-rated face wash for combination skin, designed to cleanse and nourish](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Top-rated%20face%20wash%20for%20combination%20skin%2C%20designed%20to%20cleanse%20and%20nourish_0.png)\n\n**Tags:** Combination Skin, Skincare Routine, Face Wash, Cleansing, Combination skin, T-zone and oily skin, gel-foam cleanser, Ingredients\n\n## Keep reading to know...\n\n\n\nWhat do you do first when you enter your bathroom to get ready for the day? Your hand reaches out for your face wash, perhaps the most tedious of all tasks and yet the most important one. I swear by cleansing my face in the morning and before going to bed. Sure, I have those moments when by the end of a long, tiring day, I’m lazy and can’t be bothered to put in the effort of cleansing, then applying an eye cream and then my night cream. But, as someone who has combination and sensitive skin, I can vouch for this practice of cleansing twice a day.\n\nThe question arises ‘How does one choose the right face wash for combination skin?’. In a world of new skincare launches arriving every single day, it can be hard to choose anyone that just works perfectly. To top it off, dealing with combination skin can be tricky. Even as a <a href=\"https://www.bebeautiful.in/all-things-skin/everyday/simplify-your-skin-care-routine\" target=\"_blank\">skincare</a> fanatic who diligently reads every packaging of the skincare products I use, I get overwhelmed too with the choices available in the market and which products I need out of those.\n\nSo, let’s break it down for you.\n\n\n\n## How To Choose the Right Face Wash for Combination Skin\n\n**Step 1: You need a balanced formula**\n\nCombination skin means having an oily T-zone and some other oily areas while also dealing with dry skin in yet other areas. You need a face wash that leaves your skin balanced overall, removing excess oil and dirt from parts while also hydrating the dry parts. Tricky? Not really.\n\nTo balance it out, you need a **<a href=\"https://www.paulaschoice.in/collections/combination/products/resist-perfectly-balanced-foaming-cleanser\" target=\"_blank\">Perfectly Balanced Foaming Cleanser by Paula’s Choice</a>**. This one works on the skin without disturbing the skin's protective barrier. It has ceramides that prevent moisture loss, hyaluronic acid that provides lightweight but lasting hydration, and aloe extract that soothes skin irritation.\n\nNow, the question you need to ask yourself is - “**Does my skin feel tight after washing?**”\n\n**If yes**, choose a cleanser that hydrates while it cleanses. **<a href=\"https://dermalogica.in/products/special-cleansing-gel-face-wash\" target=\"_blank\">Dermalogica’s Special Cleansing Gel Face Wash</a>** is a soap-free, foaming gel that cleanses all skin conditions. It’ll wash impurities without stripping away the moisture. It also has calming balm mint and lavender extract to soothe the skin.\n\n**If not**, try a formula that targets breakouts and acne, if any. **<a href=\"https://www.murad.com/products/clarifying-acne-cleanser?srsltid=AfmBOoq8UyWSjZrPbzxjWEPtDbymQYS8xiiyEb8ooFeN43aO38ZPLVMN\" target=\"_blank\">Acne Control Clarifying Cleanser by Murad</a>** is a good one to start with.\n\n**Step 2: Gel vs. Foam: Which Face Wash for Combination Skin is Best?**\n\nIf you’re looking to target oiliness in the T-zone while being gentle on dry patches, you need a gel cleanser. They are designed to deeply cleanse the skin by removing dirt, excess oil, and impurities from the pores. **<a href=\"https://ponds.in/products/ponds-hydra-light-hyaluronic-acid-hydrating-gel-facewash-hydrate-and-glow?srsltid=AfmBOoohfdVvmnxGMHOH2mtM-62kzrSY2sWpPlf2y91C6It6vjt8c2_F&amp;variant=45391283159273\" target=\"_blank\">Pond’s Hydra Light Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Gel Facewash</a>** will cleanse the skin just the right way. Unlike other gel face washes that leave the skin feeling dry and tight after use, this one won’t dry out the skin.\n\nIf you’re looking for a cleanser that is effective but doesn’t over-dry your skin, go for a **foam cleanser**. They give a good frothy foam wash that can penetrate your skin’s pores to remove grime, dust, and other icky things. A gentle cleanser would be **<a href=\"https://www.novology.com/products/sensitive-skin-cleanser?srsltid=AfmBOoo-KO_nQ56Pyza12d0FFvrQOUJpiHf7izkKJUZDI9S_gONinb0W\" target=\"_blank\">Novology’s Moisture Barrier Booster Cleanser</a>** which will leave your face squeaky clean while being kind to the skin.\n\n**Step 3: Ingredients to Look for in the Best Face Wash for Combination Skin **\n\nYou want to look for ingredients that balance hydration and control oil. Your best bets are :\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid that provides lightweight hydration without clogging pores.\n* Aloe Vera that soothes and hydrates dry patches while being non-greasy.\n* Salicylic Acid that gently exfoliates and unclogs pores, reducing excess oil and preventing breakouts.\n* Niacinamide that balances sebum production and reduces inflammation.\n* Green Tea Extract is a natural antioxidant that calms and mattifies oily areas.\n* Ceramides: strengthen the skin barrier, ensuring that both dry and oily areas stay healthy.\n\n**Additionally**, you must consider the pH balance as well. It’s advisable to look for a cleanser with a pH between 4.5-6 to maintain your skin’s natural barrier. This prevents dryness and sensitivity while keeping oil in check.\n\n## The Verdict?\n\nJust like your moisturizers and serums, different face cleansers work differently for skin types. When dealing with combination skin, we’re looking at both oily and dry areas on the surface of your face. So, while picking a face wash you can keep in mind the ingredients, pH level and the type of cleanser–foam or gel. The right ingredients can help balance oiliness in some areas (like the T-zone) and dryness in others. I’d say, try different face washes and see the results on your skin.\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Praneet Sahni Kalani](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/praneet-kalani.png)\n\nPraneet Sahni KalaniPraneet Sahni Kalani is a fashion & lifestyle writer.

    "content": "# What Is HD Makeup? Everything You Need to Know for a Flawless Finish\n\n> Home > Makeup > Face\n\n**Author:** Keerat Kohli\n**Date:** 09 Jan ‘25\n\n![HD makeup for perfectly smooth and glamorous skin.](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/HD%20makeup%20for%20perfectly%20smooth%20and%20glamorous%20skin_0.png)\n\n**Tags:** HD Makeup, Flawless Finish, Skin Prep, Makeup Technique, Foundation, Concealer, Contouring, Setting\n\n## Keep reading to know...\n\n\n\nIn this era of high-definition screens and social media close-ups, makeup needs to do more than just conceal—it has to enhance while staying undetectable. Enter HD makeup: the secret sauce for creating a smooth, second-skin finish that looks flawless, both in person and on camera. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/the_lipstick_diary?igsh=MW9rd280NXRxanh5ZQ%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\">Pooja Lalwani Tamang</a>, makeup artist and founder of Fitface, describes it as “a real-life filter that delivers a smooth, second-skin finish. It uses light diffusing products to create a smooth, flawless finish that looks natural yet camera-ready. Thin layers, buildable textures, and blending, no cakey vibes allowed.” Here’s everything you need to know about HD makeup and how you can master it.\n\n\n\n## What is HD Makeup?\n\nUnlike traditional makeup, which can appear heavy or settle into fine lines under bright lights, HD makeup features ultra-fine particles that scatter light, blurring imperfections and creating a seamless look. It’s lightweight, buildable, and crafted to deliver a second-skin effect that looks just as good in person as it does on camera.\n\nThink of it as the perfect marriage of skincare and makeup—a real-life “Paris” filter. With HD makeup, every pore, wrinkle, and blemish gets blurred into near invisibility, yet the skin’s natural texture still shines through.\n\n“It’s all about lightweight, buildable layers and seamless blending,” says Pooja when asked about the <a href=\"https://www.bebeautiful.in/all-things-makeup/everyday/easy-makeup-step-by-step-guide-for-beginners\" target=\"_blank\">steps for makeup</a>. The result is a polished, natural look that enhances your features without masking them—perfect for weddings, red carpets, or any time you need to be the main character.\n\n## Why Is HD Makeup Suddenly So Popular?\n\nHD makeup has gained cult status among beauty enthusiasts, and for good reason. Its lightweight, buildable texture ensures your skin looks fresh without feeling weighed down. Perfect for all girls on the move who want a flawless finish and do not want to cake up their faces. “It balances shine, texture, and skin concerns while giving the skin a natural radiance,” explains Pooja.\n\nHere’s what sets it apart:\n\n* Light-Diffusing Formulas: These create a soft-focus effect, blurring imperfections like pores and fine lines.\n* Buildable Texture: Thin layers allow you to customize coverage without the heaviness of traditional makeup.\n* Camera-Ready Finish: Perfectly suited for high-resolution cameras, it looks just as good in person.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Step-by-Step Guide to Applying HD Makeup Like a Pro**\n\n## 1. Prep Your Skin\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Prep%20your%20skin.png)\n\nSkin prep is non-negotiable. It is the most important part of your routine. Start with a deep yet hydrating cleanser followed by exfoliation to remove dead skin cells. Hydrate your skin using a lightweight moisturizer or serum to ensure a smooth base. We recommend the <a href=\"https://www.lakmeindia.com/products/lakme-glycolic-illuminate-serum-with-1-glycolic-acid-reduces-dullness-improves-texture-1\" target=\"_blank\">Lakme Glycolic Illuminate Serum</a>. Finish with a blurring primer to minimize the appearance of pores and fine lines. For an extra boost, some professionals recommend facial massages, face workouts and using a gua sha to enhance circulation and sculpt the face.\n\n## 2. Lay the Foundation\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Lay%20the%20Foundation.png)\n\nChoose an HD foundation that matches your skin tone perfectly. Using a damp beauty blender, apply thin, buildable layers, focusing on blending. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/Elle-18-Lasting-Foundation-Marble/dp/B0854BTPTP?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Elle 18 Lasting Glow Liquid Radiant Full Coverage Foundation</a> works like a charm. Techniques like stippling and buffing can help the foundation meld seamlessly into your skin without settling into lines.\n\n## 3. Conceal and Correct\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Conceal%20and%20Correct.png)\n\nFor areas that need extra attention, such as dark circles or blemishes, use a lightweight, buildable concealer. Spot-concealing with precision brushes ensures you’re addressing specific concerns without overloading the skin.\n\n## 4. Add Dimension\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Add%20Dimension.png)\n\nSubtle contouring and highlighting are key to enhancing your features. Use cream-based products for a more natural look, blending them meticulously for a seamless finish. Avoid heavy powders, as they can emphasize texture under HD scrutiny. The <a href=\"https://www.lakmeindia.com/products/lakme-facelift-multislayer-contour-stick?variant=40933459427463\" target=\"_blank\">Lakme Facelift MultiSlayer Contour Stick</a> promises the best results due to its creamy and buildable nature.\n\n## 5. Set with Care\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Set%20With%20care.png)\n\nSwap heavy powders for fine, translucent ones to lightly set your makeup. Focus on areas prone to shine, such as the T-zone. Alternatively, opt for a lightweight setting spray to lock in the look while maintaining a dewy finish.\n\n## 6. Finish with Flawless Details\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Finish%20with%20Flawless%20Details.png)\n\nComplete your makeup look with an HD-friendly blush, lip colour, and eyeshadow. Opt for satin or matte finishes that complement the overall natural aesthetic of HD makeup.\n\n## The Role of Skin Prep\n\n“Your makeup is only as good as your skin prep,” emphasizes Pooja. For an HD-ready base, focus on creating a smooth, hydrated canvas. Pooja recommends exfoliation, followed by layering hydrating serums and moisturizers. “Sometimes I’ll do 10 layers of skincare before applying even one layer of makeup,” she shares. This ensures the skin looks plump and radiant, enhancing the overall effect of HD makeup. Here is how you can ace HD makeup regardless of your skin type:\n\n* Mature Skin: Hydration is crucial. Opt for lightweight, water-based foundations that won’t settle into fine lines.\n* Oily Skin: Use a mattifying primer like the Lakme Unreal Blur Perfect Primer and oil-free products to keep shine under control.\n* Acne-Prone Skin: HD formulas are often non-comedogenic, making them ideal for those with sensitive or acne-prone skin. Spot-concealing ensures coverage without clogging pores.\n\nHD makeup is more than just a trend—it’s a technique that redefines how we approach beauty. With the right products, proper skin prep, and a few pro tips, you can achieve that flawless, photo-ready look every time. HD makeup’s fine particles scatter light to blur imperfections, creating a smooth, even finish. It balances shine and texture, ensuring skin looks natural and polished, no matter how close the lens gets.\n\nWhether it’s for a major event or simply a day you want to feel your best, HD makeup ensures you’ll be glowing—no filter required.\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Keerat Kohli](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/Keerat%20Kohli.png)\n\nKeerat KohliKeerat Kohli is a beauty and lifestyle writer who often boasts her expertise as the self-proclaimed beauty guru of her friend group.
