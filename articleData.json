This modern take on crimping adds a unique twist without overwhelming your overall style.\n* Pro Tip: This is a must-try for post-root touchups.

Here’s what you need to do:\n\n1. Seal the Style: Use a lightweight hairspray to lock in the texture without making your hair feel stiff or crunchy.\n2. Add Volume: For extra oomph, gently tease the roots with a comb.\n3. Hydrate: Crimping can dry out your hair, so use a nourishing hair serum or oil on the ends to keep them hydrated.\n4. Touch Up: If some sections lose their crimp, quickly go over them with your crimper or a flat iron twist. Protect\n5. Overnight: Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce frizz and keep your crimped hairstyles intact.\n\n## Why Crimped Hairstyles Are Perfect for Long Hair?\n\n**<img alt=\"Why-Crimped-Hairstyles-Are-Perfect-for-Long-Hair\" class=\"img-full\" data-entity-type=\"\" data-entity-uuid=\"\" src=\"https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Why-Crimped-Hairstyles-Are-Perfect-for-Long-Hair.png\">**\n\nCrimped hairstyles add depth, texture, and volume, making them an ideal choice for hairstyles for long hair.

This style incorporates multiple braids, often intertwined or twisted, to form an elaborate bun. It’s a perfect match for heavily embellished bridal outfits and grand ceremonies, ensuring the hairstyle commands attention while staying secure throughout the festivities.\n\n## Expert Advice for the Perfect Juda Hairstyle\n\nThe perfect bridal juda can truly elevate your look to a another level. Here’s how you can ensure your hairstyle looks flawless and stays intact throughout your special day:\n\n**1. Start with Clean, Prepped Hair:**\n\nWhile freshly washed hair can be slippery, slightly day-old hair holds styles better. If your hair tends to get oily, use a dry shampoo to add freshness without losing texture. This step works well for all styles, especially when paired with haircuts for long hair, like layers or feathered ends, which add movement and enhance the overall look.\n\n**2. Texture Is Key:**\n\nFor a voluminous look, start by adding texture. Use a texturizing spray, mousse, or volumising powder to give your hair a good grip. This helps create structure and prevents the bun from looking flat.\n\n**3. Secure the Base:**\n\nA solid foundation is crucial for a juda that lasts all day. Section your hair properly and use elastic bands to tie it securely before starting the bun. This prevents slippage and ensures longevity.\n\n**4. Invest in Quality Tools:**\n\nOpt for sturdy pins, strong-hold hairspray, and high-quality elastics. This is a non-negotiable to keep your juda intact through hours of celebrations, dancing, and rituals.\n\n**5. Add Personal Touches:**\n\nCollaborate with your hairstylist to incorporate details that match your wedding aesthetic. Be it fresh flowers, Gajras, ornate pins, or jewellery, ensure your juda compliments your outfit and enhances your overall look.\n\n**6. Balance Is Key:**\n\nChoose a style that works with your face shape and outfit. For example, a sleek bun suits traditional sarees, while a messy textured juda can complement boho-inspired lehengas.\n\n**7. Test the Style in Advance:**\n\nSchedule a trial session with your hairstylist before the big day. This ensures the look aligns with your vision and gives you a chance to make any adjustments.\n\n**8. Stay Comfortable:**\n\nFinally, ensure the juda is not too tight or heavy. A styled bun should be secure yet comfortable enough to wear for hours without causing discomfort.\n\n## Jewellery and Florals: The Essential Accents\n\nA hallmark of juda hairstyles is their versatility with accessories. Brides can opt for fresh roses, jasmine strands, or marigold arrangements to lend a natural, traditional look to their bridal hair juda. For a grander statement, some brides incorporate family heirlooms like vintage brooches or gold-finished hairpieces into their juda. Paired with haircuts for long hair, such as soft layers or face-framing cuts, these elements add depth and a touch of personal history to the hairstyle, making it as meaningful as it is beautiful.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn its many forms, the bridal hair juda remains an ideal style for weddings and celebrations. Its ability to adapt to different aesthetics—traditional, modern, or fusion—ensures its place as a cult favorite. For brides and celebrants alike and with the right accessories and expert styling, the juda becomes the perfect addition to a bridal look.\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Keerat Kohli](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/Keerat%20Kohli.png)\n\nKeerat KohliKeerat Kohli is a beauty and lifestyle writer who often boasts her expertise as the self-proclaimed beauty guru of her friend group.

It’s been popular among men for some time now and is unlikely to go away in 2025. Fade haircuts are everywhere and easy to get. Walk into a salon and just sit and ask for one, your barber will know what to do. It’s manageable, sharp and relatively low maintenance as well. David Beckham loves it. Brad Pitt too. And Cillian Murphy a.k.a Thomas Shelby, the fictional character and protagonist of the British period crime drama Peaky Blinders aced it to the next level. My consensus? It’s a pretty modern look for both genders. However, the faded haircut has a winding history and stretches back decades\n\n\n\n## Understanding Low Fade Haircuts\n\nOriginating in the 1940-1950 era from the U.S. military, this well-groomed haircut has many variations, each created with harsh lines and angles that signalled you mean business. To dive deeper into this, I reached out to **<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vaishakhi_haria/\" target=\"_blank\">Vaishakhi Haria</a>**, founder of Splash Salons in multiple locations in Mumbai, and co-founder of Very V Salon in Borivali, having amassed 17 years of experience in the hairdressing industry. So, <a href=\"https://www.bebeautiful.in/all-things-hair/haircuts-and-styles/why-the-low-fade-is-the-most-versatile-men-haircut\" target=\"_blank\">what is a low fade haircut?</a> “Fades can bring out the bone structure of the person and it brings sharpness to the overall look”, she comments on the hairstyle. For those looking to limit regular visits to barbers, this may be a good one as fades take a long to grow out. “If you intend to grow the fade out, you have to be ready to wait a minimum of 6 months without a haircut. For some men, this can be a bit frustrating.”\n\n## Low Fade Haircuts For Different Face Shapes\n\nFade haircuts vary and are large of three types. The low skin fade is approximately 1 inch above the natural hairline. The fade drops down behind the ears and around the back of the head, keeping an inch of skin shown relatively even all the way around. It’s clean and neat. With a mid-fade, the skin runs higher up on the head, starting from around the brow, it again drops down behind the ears and behind the back of the head, but drops only a little at the back. High fade on the other hand is also a polished and sharp look that involves a dramatic tapering of the hair at a higher point on the head. Vaishakhi adds, “A classic low fade is a style that never goes out of trend and it suits most hair types. Keeping the top a bit longer gives versatility in styling the hair in various ways.”\n\nThe key is to know which fade hairstyle works for you. We did the next best thing; we asked the expert herself.\n\n## Fade Haircut For Square Face Shape - The Short Low Fade Haircut\n\n**Why it Works?**\n\nHighlighting the angular jawline, this style features a textured top that adds dimension, preventing the haircut from looking too harsh. Plus, it’s versatile, modern, and universally stylish.\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Sqaure%20shaped.png)\n\n## Fade Haircut For Oval Face Shape - Low Taper Fade\n\n**Why it works?**\n\nThis style starts low near the sideburns and gradually tapers down to the neckline, creating a subtle gradient. Unlike a traditional fade, the taper keeps some hair at the edges for a softer finish. It’s ideal for men with thin hair because it adds structure and sharpness to your overall look. So, by keeping the sides short and the top slightly longer, this cut creates the illusion of more volume.\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/oval%20shaped.png)\n\n## Fade Haircut For Round Face Shape - Classic Low Fade and Mid Fade with a Long Top\n\n**Why it works?**\n\nA low fade or mid fade paired with a long top is the perfect combination for a round face. It starts low, just above the ears, and gradually tapers down to the neckline. The long top adds height and creates the illusion of length, balancing out the roundness.\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Round.png)\n\n## Fade Haircut For Heart Face Shape - A Bald Fade\n\n![](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Heart%20shaped.png)\n\n**Why it Works?**\n\nA heart-shaped face features a broad forehead, prominent cheekbones, and a narrow chin. To complement and balance this, a bald fade works perfectly.\n\nOnce you’ve zeroed down on which type of fade works best for your face shape, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Maintenance: When thinking about maintenance, usually 3 weeks is an ideal timeline to visit your hairdresser.\n2. Wash regularly and use a hair mask: You can try a leave-in treatment mask that aids in repairing hair damage and restoring hair to a healthy state. A professional molecular repair mask by K-18 will work wonders. This award-winning cream-based mask delivers immediate and lasting results.\n3. Invest in quality products: Whether it’s simply washing your hair or styling, always use good quality products for best results. Try Toni&Guy’s Sea Salt Texturising Hair Spray. It adds texture and volume, leaving you with a crunchy feel.\n4. Protect your hair: Over styling can easily lead to hair fall, pushing back your hairline without you even noticing it until it’s too late. A heat protection mist is strongly recommended.\n5. Choose a trusted hairstylist: Even though it’s a simple haircut, an experienced barber will be able to create seamless gradients.\n\nYou’re all set to create your perfect low fade hairstyle now!\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Praneet Sahni Kalani](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/praneet-kalani.png)\n\nPraneet Sahni KalaniPraneet Sahni Kalani is a fashion & lifestyle writer.

Once a staple in vintage glamour and early 2000s fashion, this timeless look is evolving in exciting ways. Whether you're looking for a sleek, polished finish or a relaxed, undone vibe, the side part is here to add a fresh twist to your style.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll break down how the side part has made its comeback, explore the best haircut styles for different hair types, and give you all the tips and tricks for maintaining this effortlessly chic look. Ready to embrace the side part revolution? Let’s dive in!\n\n\n\n## The Evolution of the Side Part Haircut: From Classic to Modern\n\n1. The Side Part’s Retro Influence : The side part has a rich history that can be traced back to the 1920s, where it symbolized the height of sophistication and elegance. Think of the sharply parted, slicked-back styles of silent film stars or the polished looks of Hollywood’s golden age. Over the decades, the side part evolved, embracing softer waves in the 1950s and voluminous blowouts in the 1980s. Fast forward to the 2000s, and we see the side part reemerge as a casual go-to for celebrities and everyday individuals alike, with everyone from Jennifer Aniston to David Beckham making it a must-have look. Now in 2024, the side part is back – this time with modern updates that make it suitable for all genders and hair textures.\n2. Modern Twists on the Classic Look : In 2024, the side part is no longer just about being sleek and polished. The trend now incorporates textured finishes, edgy layers, and even messy waves. From soft, romantic curls to a more structured, asymmetrical part, hairstylists are taking the side part to new levels. This modern approach gives it a fresh, youthful vibe that’s adaptable for both everyday wear and special occasions.\n3. Gender-Neutral Appeal : The side part’s appeal in 2024 is not just for women. Men have been adopting the look for years, making it a versatile and gender-neutral trend. Whether paired with a short, structured cut or long, flowing locks, the side part works for everyone. It’s a perfect balance of classic meets contemporary, and its adaptability is a key reason for its resurgence.\n4. Best Face Shapes for the Side Part : While the side part is universally flattering, it tends to suit certain face shapes better. Oval, square, and heart-shaped faces benefit the most from this style, as it helps balance features and adds structure. For round faces, a deep side part can create the illusion of length, while angular faces can soften their features with a gentler, sweeping part.\n\n## 2024’s Trending Side Part Haircuts for Different Hair Types\n\n1. Side Parts for Curly Hair : For those with curly hair, the side part is a game changer. By embracing your hair’s natural volume and texture, a side part can enhance curls, creating a look that’s both structured and playful. Go for a soft, romantic part with loose curls or a more defined part for a dramatic statement.\n2. Fine and Straight Hair : If you have fine or straight hair, a side part can instantly add dimension and volume. Shifting your part to the side breaks up the flatness, giving your hair a fuller, more dynamic appearance. Pair the side part with layers or a sleek bob for maximum effect.\n3. Thick and Wavy Hair : For thick, wavy hair, the side part is the perfect way to enhance your natural texture. A deep side part can add a touch of sophistication, while a loose, undone part will create a more relaxed, bohemian vibe. The side part offers the flexibility to play with volume, making it ideal for both casual and formal looks.\n4. Short to Long Cuts : The beauty of the side part is its versatility, whether you have a pixie cut, bob, or long layers. Pixie cuts with a side part can look edgy and modern, while bobs take on a chic, Parisian flair. For those with longer hair, a side part can frame your face and add a touch of elegance or drama, depending on how deep the part is.\n\n## How to Style and Maintain the Perfect Side Part\n\n1. Heat-Free Styling Tips : Want to rock a side part without damaging your hair? Achieving the perfect part doesn’t always require heat styling tools. For curly or wavy hair, braiding your hair overnight can create a natural, heat-free wave that works well with a side part. For straighter hair, wrapping or rolling your hair while it’s damp can help create soft volume.\n2. Product Recommendations : To maintain your side part, it’s essential to use the right products. For those with fine or straight hair, a lightweight mousse or volumizing spray can add lift and texture. For curly or thicker hair, a cream or gel can help define and control the part, keeping frizz at bay while giving your style a polished finish. Look for products that offer hold without making your hair stiff or crunchy.\n3. Tools for the Job : A good comb and hairdryer are essential tools when creating a side part. A fine-tooth comb will help create a precise parting line, while a hairdryer with a nozzle attachment can help set your style in place. For those looking to create a sleek, straight side part, a flat iron is a must. But remember, less is more when it comes to heat – always use a heat protectant!\n4. Day-to-Night Versatility : The side part is perfect for transitioning from day to night. For a casual daytime look, keep the part soft and slightly undone. When heading out for an evening event, smooth down flyaways with a bit of serum and tuck one side behind your ear for a sleek, sophisticated look.\n\n## Cultural Influence on the Side Part’s Comeback\n\n1. Celebrity Endorsements : Celebrities are playing a huge role in bringing the side part back into the spotlight. From A-listers strutting the red carpet to influencers posting their looks on social media, the side part is once again becoming a go-to style for glam moments.\n2. TikTok and Gen Z Trends : Social media platforms like TikTok have reignited the debate between middle and side parts. While Gen Z was initially all about the middle part, a wave of new influencers and content creators are bringing back the side part, proving that it’s not just a millennial trend but a timeless look.\n3. Hollywood Glamour : Old-school Hollywood glamour is making a comeback, with stars channeling vintage waves and deep side parts on the red carpet. This nod to classic elegance is a major reason why the side part is making such a strong return.\n4. Nostalgic Fashion Resurgence : With the 90s and early 2000s trends back in fashion, it’s no surprise that the side part has followed suit. This nostalgic revival has made the side part a key player in today’s beauty and fashion scene.\n\n## Why the Side Part is Here to Stay in 2024\n\n1. The Middle Part Fatigue : After years of middle parts dominating the hair scene, many are turning to the side part for a fresh, dynamic look. It offers a break from the uniformity of the middle part and allows for more versatility in styling.\n2. Effortlessly Chic : The side part is effortlessly chic and requires little maintenance. Its adaptability to different hair types and styles ensures that it will remain a favourite among hairstylists and individuals alike.\n3. Complimenting Current Fashion Trends : From minimalistic fashion to romantic silhouettes, the side part pairs perfectly with current trends, adding just the right amount of structure and sophistication to any look.\n4. Workplace to Weekend : Perhaps the most compelling reason for the side part’s staying power is its versatility. Whether you’re in a corporate setting or enjoying a weekend brunch, the side part is the perfect go-to hairstyle.\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Manya Makhija](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/manya-makhija.png)\n\nManya MakhijaManya Makhija is a fashion and lifestyle writer.

    "content": "# The Best Face Moisturizers for Oily Skin: Say Goodbye to Grease\n\n> Home > Skin > Products\n\n**Author:** Manya Makhija\n**Date:** 15 Jan ‘25\n\n![Effective moisturizers for oily skin to maintain balance and prevent greasiness](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/2025-01/Effective%20moisturizers%20for%20oily%20skin%20to%20maintain%20balance%20and%20prevent%20greasiness_0.jpg)\n\n**Tags:** Oily skin, Moisturizer, Skincare, niacinamide, Oily Skin, Moisturizers, Skincare Ingredients, Application Tips\n\n## Keep reading to know...\n\n\n\nIf you think moisturizer isn’t for oily skin, think again! It’s a common misconception that oily skin doesn’t need hydration, but skipping this crucial step can cause your skin to overcompensate by producing even more oil. The right moisturizer can balance oil production, prevent greasy shine, and keep your skin healthy and hydrated without clogging your pores. In this guide, we’ll explore the best face moisturizers for oily skin, share tips for selecting non-comedogenic products, and highlight expert-approved application techniques to maximize their benefits.\n\n\n\n## Why Moisturizer Is Essential for Oily Skin\n\nContrary to popular belief, oily skin can be dehydrated too. When your skin lacks moisture, it can overproduce sebum to compensate, leading to clogged pores, acne, and a shiny complexion. Using a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer ensures your skin stays hydrated without feeling greasy, keeping your complexion balanced and healthy.\n\n## Benefits of Moisturizer for Oily Skin\n\n* Balances Oil Production: Prevents overproduction of sebum by keeping your skin hydrated.\n* Reduces Breakouts: Non-comedogenic moisturizer formulas won’t clog pores, reducing acne risk.\n* Improves Texture: Hydration minimizes the appearance of large pores and smoothens the skin.\n* Supports Barrier Function: Strengthens your skin’s moisture barrier, preventing external irritants from causing damage.\n\n## Top Ingredients to Look For\n\nFinding the best moisturizer cream for oily skin involves knowing what ingredients to embrace and avoid.\n\n**Hero Ingredients**\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid: A lightweight hydrator that attracts water to the skin without adding oil.\n* Niacinamide: Balances sebum production and soothes inflammation.\n* Aloe Vera: Calms and hydrates skin while being non-greasy.\n* Salicylic Acid: Controls oil and keeps pores clear.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Ingredients to Avoid**\n\n* Heavy Oils: Such as coconut oil or mineral oil, which can clog pores.\n* Synthetic Fragrances: Can irritate sensitive, oily skin.\n* Silicones: May create a slippery feel but can lead to clogged pores over time.\n\n## The Best Moisturizers for Oily Skin\n\nHere’s a curated list of top-performing moisturizers that deliver hydration without the shine.\n\n1. Simple Protecting Light Moisturiser (125 ml): This lightweight moisturizer is ideal for daytime use, offering SPF protection while keeping skin hydrated. Its non-comedogenic formula ensures no clogged pores, making it perfect for oily and combination skin.\n2. Simple Ultra-Light Liquid Moisturiser (60 ml): With its water-like texture, this moisturizer sinks into the skin instantly, leaving no residue. It’s a fantastic choice for those who prefer ultra-light hydration.\n3. Novology Moisture Barrier Booster - Cream: Designed to strengthen the skin’s barrier, this cream is perfect for nighttime use. Its blend of ceramides and probiotics works to repair and protect the skin while controlling oiliness.\n4. Dove Men Face Moisturiser - Oil: Control Specially formulated for men, this moisturizer offers all-day oil control and hydration. It’s perfect for combating shine while keeping the skin soft and smooth.\n\n## Application Tips for Maximum Benefits\n\nUsing the best face moisturizer for oily skin isn’t enough—you need to apply it the right way for optimal results.\n\n1. Prep Your Skin: Start with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, oil, and makeup. Follow with a toner to balance your skin’s pH and tighten pores.\n2. Use the Right Amount: A pea-sized amount of moisturizer is usually sufficient for your entire face. Over-applying can overwhelm your skin and lead to a greasy feel.\n3. Layer Correctly: Apply moisturizer after serums but before sunscreen in the morning. For nighttime, it’s the last step after any treatments or serums.\n4. Customize for Day and Night: Opt for lightweight gel or SPF-infused moisturizers during the day, and richer, repairing formulas at night to support your skin’s recovery process.\n\n## Special Considerations: Matching Moisturizers to Your Skin’s Needs\n\nNot all oily skin is the same. Tailoring your moisturizer to your specific needs ensures you get the best results.\n\n* Combination Skin: Use a lightweight moisturizer on oilier areas and slightly richer products on drier patches.\n* Acne-Prone Skin: Choose non-comedogenic, oil-free formulas to hydrate without triggering breakouts.\n* Sensitive Skin: Stick to gentle, fragrance-free moisturizers like the Simple Protecting Light Moisturiser to avoid irritation.\n\n## Men vs. Women: Are Moisturizer Needs Different?\n\nWhile both men and women need hydration and oil control, their skincare preferences and habits often differ.\n\n* For Men Men: tend to have thicker, oilier skin, making lightweight, oil-controlling moisturizers like Dove Men Face Moisturiser a practical choice.\n* For Women: Women might prefer multitasking products like Simple Protecting Light Moisturiser for daytime SPF and Novology Moisture Barrier Booster for nighttime repair.\n* Unisex Picks: The Simple Ultra-Light Liquid Moisturiser works universally, delivering effective hydration without feeling heavy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMoisturizing is a vital step in every skincare routine, even for those with oily skin. The key lies in choosing the right product—lightweight, oil-free, and packed with skin-loving ingredients. Whether you’re looking to balance oil, reduce breakouts, or improve texture, incorporating the best face moisturizer for oily skin into your routine can transform your complexion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n### About the Author\n\n![Manya Makhija](https://img.bebeautiful.in/www-bebeautiful-in/manya-makhija.png)\n\nManya MakhijaManya Makhija is a fashion and lifestyle writer.
